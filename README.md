Super Mario World Online,
Powered by EmulatorJS

Ain't no roms in da roms folder, so if you want to play a rom that isn't from nintendo, change the emulator in the <script> element in index.html, then put the rom in the roms folder. If not, make sure to dump ur own so nintendo won't track you down. (I also totally used a legal and ethical rom to test this, please don't come after me nintendo).
